        <h1>Curtis Berry Is A 49er Fan</h1>
        <p>The San Francisco 49ers, often referred to simply as the "49ers," 
            are a <strong>storied and iconic</strong> American football franchise in the National 
            Football League (NFL). Established in 1946, the team has a rich 
            history of success, with five Super Bowl championships to their 
            name. The 49ers have been home to some of the game's greatest 
            legends, including Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, and Steve Young, 
            who contributed to the team's dynasty in the 1980s and 1990s. Known 
            for their red and gold uniforms, the 49ers have a passionate and 
            dedicated fan base that fills <a href="https://www.levisstadium.com/">Levi's Stadium</a> in Santa Clara, 
            California, with enthusiasm and energy on game days. With a 
            legacy of <strong>excellence</strong> and a commitment to <strong>winning</strong>, the San Francisco 
            49ers continue to be a prominent force in the NFL and a source of 
            pride for their fans.</p>
